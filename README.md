# EVM Beginner Assessment (Project)

This Solidity project serves as the final assessment for Metacrafter's EVM Beginner Course. 

## Description

This is a simple Solidity program that aims to show how minting and burning tokens work. Thus, the main functions of this program are Mint and Burn.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

This program can be run using Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Remix can be accessed through their website, [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

In the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon on the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy the source code from the Assessment.sol file in this repository, and paste it in the file you created.

In order to compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" or any compatible version. You should then see a blue button with a "Compile (Your File Name).sol". Click that button to compile the code.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the the contract with your file name from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the Mint & Burn functions. You can get the input for "_address" by copying the code from the "Account" section. The value can be whatever integer, as long as it is not negative. Click on the "Transact" button to execute transactions.
